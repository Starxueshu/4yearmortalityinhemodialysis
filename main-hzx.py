This enables prompt detection and intervention in case of unexpected mortality. Furthermore, in individuals assessed as low-risk, a more conservative approach to hemodialysis management may be suitable. This includes avoiding unnecessary pharmacological therapy or frequent detection, and restricting interventions to specific clinical indications.")

This includes optimizing their cardiac function including increasing heart ejection fraction and decreasing ischemic heart disease, avoiding infection, promoting nutrition condition, and even considering pharmacological interventions to improve those parameters. In addition, a comprehensive hemodialysis management plan should be implemented for high-risk patients. This may involve suitable ultrafiltration dehydration during hemodialysis, appropriate choice of dialysis methods, proper nutrition and regular routine cardiac color Doppler ultrasound based on individual needs.")
